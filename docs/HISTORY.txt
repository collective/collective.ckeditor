  [thomasdesvenain]


3.6.8 (2012-12-13)
------------------

- Update install and uninstall to change the default_editor site
  property instead of the wysiwyg_editor memberdata property.
  [maurits]

- Also check the default_editor site property when determining whether
  the member wants to use CKeditor.
  [maurits]

- Changed the way external plugins are registered. It's better to use the three
  parameter variant of ``CKEDITOR.plugins.addExternal`` because this will make
  the base URL for the plugin resources available within the plugin code as
  ``this.path`` correctly. Otherwise ``this.path`` contains the full URL to the
  plugin script itself which consequently breaks loading of related resources
  (images, translations, etc).
  [dokai]

- Refactored the ``ck_ruid_to_url`` transform to use plone.app.uuid to transform
  UIDs to URLs. This avoids using reference_catalog in favor of portal_catalog
  and appears to fix issues with Dexterity types not available through the
  reference_catalog.
  [dokai]

- Limited string length to be searched under 3000 characters by re.search method.
